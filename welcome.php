		<h1>Welcome to C</h1>
		<p>C (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose computer
		programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at
		the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.</p>
		<p>Although C was designed for implementing system software, it is also
		widely used for developing portable application software.</p>
		<p>C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and
		there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not
		exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages,
		most notably C++, which began as an extension to C.</p>
